### DESCRIPTION 

A Simple Plugin which shows TeamMates money during FreezeTime. There are 2 modes currently in the plugin which can be controlled through cvar provided showMoney = 1 ( Shows whole Team Money ) / 2 ( Shows money of teamMate you Aim )

**1** : Will show the money of whole Team in a proper Lineup !! <br>
**2** : It shows the money of your teamMate only when you Aim at him , so basically you can Aim at any of your TeamMate to get their money 

**Note** : Plugin wont work properly if you have a very low Freezetime in your server, plugin's main Purpose is to check money of teamMates and to get weapon drops from them in the time 

I think it is useful for Competitives and Automix Servers where freezetime is long and you need weapon drops from your teamMates 

**CSTRIKE Module** is used which makes it for CounterStrike only
